        <p>
          I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
          This portfolio is more than a showcase — it's a demonstration of how role-based access and modern security practices can elevate developer workflows.

        <h2>👨‍💻 My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          I believe every developer should have a portfolio that not only highlights their skills but also reflects real-world application architecture. 
          That’s why I built this platform with authentication, role-based access, and secure session management — just like a production-grade app.
